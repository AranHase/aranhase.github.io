*   Test blueprint with robust algorithm
*   Arrays/for loops
*   Build entire game with blueprint
*   Use component-based entity system

*   "Expose on spawn" Is awesome! act more like a constructor!

*   Remove "On Tick" from the blueprint, even if it doesn't have ANY connection!

*   Lots of time spend making things look good
*   Awkward to add new commands before what you already got
