After trying many different terminal emulators to work with split panes and
facing all sort of problems I decided to give "vim + tmux + [tmuxifier][1]" a
try, and here is my setup.


Fixing wrong colors with vim
============================

The main issue I got with this setup is vim showing wrong colors. To fix this
problem I had to setup a few files. For the tmuxifier I had to setup
`~/.bashrc` as:

    export PATH="${tmuxifier_dir}/bin:$PATH"
    export TMUXIFIER_TMUX_OPTS="-2"
    eval "$(tmuxifier init -)"


The `TMUXIFIER_TMUX_OPTS` var is important to force tmux to work with 256
colors. I also had to create a `~/.tmux.conf` file:

    set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"


And that should fix the color issue.

Creating the window layout
==========================

When working on C++ projects, I like to use one window with three panes. One
for the code+vim, one to execute tests and show errors and one to execute the
application as a user. The layout is created using tmuxifier. So, my
`cppdev.window.sh` file (located at `${tmuxifier_dir}/layouts`) is:


    # Set window root path. Default is `$session_root`.
    # Must be called before `new_window`.
    window_root "~/projects"

    # Create new window. If no argument is given, window name will be based on
    # layout file name.
    new_window "cppdev"

    # Split window into panes.
    split_h 70
    select_pane 1
    split_v 30

    # Set active pane.
    select_pane 1


and a very simple session file named `cppdev.session.sh` (also located at
`${tmuxifier_dir}/layouts`) to launch the `cppdev` window created above:

    # Create session with specified name if it does not already exist. If no
    # argument is given, session name will be based on layout file name.
    if initialize_session "Scppdev"; then
        # Load a defined window layout.
        load_window "cppdev"
        # Select the default active window on session creation. 
        select_window 1
    fi
    
    # Finalize session creation and switch/attach to it.
    finalize_and_go_to_session 
    

To launch my C++ dev environment I just run:

    $ tmuxifier load-session cppdev

Fixing `<CTRL+B>` conflict between tmux and vim
===============================================

tmux by default uses `<CTRL+B>` as the prefix key, which conflicts with the default vim shortcut to scroll a page backwards. There's an easy fix. Remap `<CTRL+B>` to `<CTRL+A>` in tmux. So, add these lines to your `~/.tmux.conf` file:

    unbind C-b
    set -g prefix C-a

My `~/.tmux.conf` with extra tweaks
===================================

    unbind C-b
    set -g prefix C-a
    
    # Window numbers are always "gapless"
    set-option -g renumber-windows on
    
    set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"
    
    # Smart pane switching with awareness of vim splits
    # requires the vim-tmux-navigator plugin for vim (https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator)
    bind -n C-h run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iqE '(^|\/)g?(view|vim?)(diff)?$' && tmux send-keys C-h) || tmux select-pane -L"
    bind -n C-j run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iqE '(^|\/)g?(view|vim?)(diff)?$' && tmux send-keys C-j) || tmux select-pane -D"
    bind -n C-k run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iqE '(^|\/)g?(view|vim?)(diff)?$' && tmux send-keys C-k) || tmux select-pane -U"
    bind -n C-l run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iqE '(^|\/)g?(view|vim?)(diff)?$' && tmux send-keys C-l) || tmux select-pane -R"
    bind -n C-\ run "(tmux display-message -p '#{pane_current_command}' | grep -iqE '(^|\/)g?(view|vim?)(diff)?$' && tmux send-keys 'C-\\') || tmux select-pane -l"
    
    # Default <ctrl+l> was to clean screen,
    # now it is <prefix><ctrl+l>
    bind C-l send-keys 'C-l'
    
    # vi cursor moviment keys
    set-window-option -g mode-keys vi
    
    # start window,pane index at 1
    set -g base-index 1
    set -g pane-base-index 1
    
    # stop tmux waiting for escape sequence
    set -s escape-time 1
    
    # move x clipboard into tmux paste buffer
    bind C-p run "xclip -o -selection clipboard | tmux load-buffer -; tmux paste-buffer"
    
    # copy selection vi-style
    bind-key -t vi-copy 'v' begin-selection
    bind-key -t vi-copy 'y' copy-selection
    
    # auto copy tmux buffer to clipboard
    bind -t vi-copy y copy-pipe "xclip -i -selection clipboard"
